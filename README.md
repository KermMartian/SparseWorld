SparseWorld: Creating Virtual Copies of the Real World
======================================================
SparseWorld is a project to create virtual analogues to the real world completely
automatically using large-scale geographic datasets. It is built on the idea that
data-collection and computing power have progressed to the point where it is feasible
to generate models of the real world in arbitrary detail with minimal human effort.
As a proof-of-concept, this system creates models of the real world as 1:1 Minecraft
maps, and is best-known for creating the island of Manhattan in Minecraft. 

Requirements
------------
The following components must be available to run SparseWorld:
 * Package: python-yaml
 * Package: python-collada (or clone and install https://github.com/pycollada/pycollada)
